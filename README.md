Markup assignment from Megobari

## CSS

Used utility classes (and css resets) provided by Tailwind CSS.
I chose this way since naming things, especially naming things RIGHT - is hard.
Overall, the design that were provided was lacking a lot of things,
there were inconsistencies with spacing, and weird/magic numbers that significantly
slowed down the development process.
Hope this passes as vanilla CSS, if it doesn't, and you, the reviewer are reading this, please let me know.


## JavaScript

Used no JS, since there was no description provided for extra functionalities.
I would rather not implement anything that is not provided to me, than waste my time and energy on it.
While "surprise" features could be nice, it also introduces inconsistency.
Problem could be solved by providing more detailed description about the assignment and/or
better design file that showcases states like button hovered state, focused etc.
